# Dynamic-Pricing-For-Urban-Parking-Lots
### Overview
#### Urban parking spaces are a limited and highly demanded resource. Prices that remain static throughout the day can lead to inefficiencies â€” either overcrowding or underutilization. To improve utilization, dynamic pricing based on demand, competition, and real-time conditions is crucial. This project simulates an intelligent, data-driven pricing engine for 14 parking spaces using real-time data streams. This project implements two dynamic pricing models for 14 urban parking slots over a span of 73 days. The data was sampled at 18 time points per day with 30 minutes of time difference (from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM the same day). 
#### The two pricing models used were:
#### Baseline Linear Model: A simple model where the next price is a function of the previous price and current occupancy:
